## IdeaBox Triples
---


#### Authors:
Kim Myers, Sally Haefling and Kayla Lawson. 


#### Built with
---
* HTML
* CSS 
* Vanilla Javascript

This project relied heavily on JavaScript. We were able to create the UI with a limited amount of HTML. This was styled with CSS (specifically Grid) and is fully responsive for large screens and mobile. 


#### Project requirements
---
Build an idea generator to create idea cards that can be stored, deleted, rated and searched. With each idea being displayed in cards on the webpage, you have the ability to edit after you save an idea which gives the user the ability to change the original idea. 


#### Goals
---
Provide a fluid and responsive client-side interface which relies on JavaScript, specifically localStorage, to persist ideas between sessions.

* Build a responsive client-side application.
* Implement client-side data persistence using localStorage.
* Iterate over dom elements in order to filter what is being displayed.
* Give user ability to delete ideas from DOM and local storage.
* Craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness.


#### Challenges
---
One large challenge introduced in this project was implementing the use of localStorage for the first time. Once we had the localStorage set up targeting specific cards in the card array, this proved to take some time because there were so many elements to move through. With so many approaches in front of us to use with each function, it was challenging to narrow down which path to take at times - specifically, with the show more/show less functionality.


#### Wins
---
We frontloaded our worktime to try to get most of the project done before the break. Our variable scoping improved a lot with this project and our code is easy to follow/using DRY standards. We were able to implement our learning from class and gain more understanding. Our gitHub workflow was effective and messages were clear and descriptive.


#### Wishlist Fixes
---
We would like to get the show more/show less function working with JavaScript. We would also like to figure out why there was a pixel increase when user types into the title input of the card. Finally, we would like to look more into accessibility standards and how we would use these with our project.
