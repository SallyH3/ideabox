## IdeaBox-Triples
Brought to you by Kim, Sally and Kayla. Also known as K.S.K. 

The foundation of the project is to help the group solidify what we have been learning in class. 

#### Technology/Framework Used
This project relied heavily on JavaScript. We were able to create the UI with a limited amount of HTML. This was styled with CSS and is fully responsive for large screens(?double-check) and mobile. 

#### Project
Build an idea generator to create idea cards that can be stored, deleted, rated and searched. With each idea being displayed in cards on the webpage, you have the ability to edit after you saved an idea. Giving the user freedom to be awesome and change the original idea. 

#### Goals
Provide a fluid and responsive client-side interface. Relying on JavaScript, and localStorage to persist ideas between sessions.

-Build a responsive client-side application.
-Implement client-side data persistence using localStorage.
-Iterate over dom elements in order to filter what is being displayed.
-Craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness.

#### Challenges

One large challenge introduced in this project was implementing the use of localStorage for the first time. Once we had the localStorage set up targeting specific cards in the card array proved to take some time because there were so many "containers" to move through. 

#### Wins

We frontloaded our worktime to try to get most of the project done before the break. 

#### Wishlist Fixes

I would like to get the show more/show less function working with JavaScript.
