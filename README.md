## IdeaBox-Triples
Brought to you by Kim, Sally and Kayla. Also known as K.S.K. 

The foundation of the project is to help the group solidify what we have been learning in class. 

#### Project
Build an idea generator that can be stored, deleted ,rated and searched. With each idea, being displayed in cards on the webpage, you have the ability to edit after you saved an idea. Giving the user freedom to be awesome and change the original idea. 

#### Goals
Provide a fluid and responsive client-side interface. Relying on JavaScript, and localStorage to persist ideas between sessions.

Build responsive client-side application.

Implement client-side data persistence using localStorage.

Iterate over dom elements in order to filter what is being displayed

Craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness
